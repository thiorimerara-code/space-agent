# AGENTS

## Introduction

Space Agent is a browser-first AI agent runtime.

The browser app is the primary runtime. The Node.js side exists as thin infrastructure around it for:

- outbound fetch proxying when the browser would otherwise hit CORS limits
- server-owned APIs and other narrow infrastructure contracts
- local development and optional desktop hosting

Documentation quality is one of the most important parts of this project. Without high-quality agent docs, agents go rogue and architecture drifts. Treat these files as part of the runtime, not as optional notes.

Documentation maintenance is top priority. After any change to a repo area, update the owning `AGENTS.md` file or files in the same session before finishing.

Implement only what the user explicitly asked for. Do not invent new features, policies, cleanup behavior, or product changes on your own. If a request would require a new behavior or policy that the user did not ask for, stop and ask first.

This repository currently keeps five agent documentation files: three primary files and two subtree-local files.

Primary agent documentation files:

- `/AGENTS.md`
- `/app/AGENTS.md`
- `/server/AGENTS.md`

Subtree-local `AGENTS.md` files may also exist when they carry scoped guidance for a specific area such as CLI commands. Keep them aligned with the primary docs instead of treating them as a separate competing documentation system.

Current subtree-local agent documentation files:

- `/commands/AGENTS.md`
- `/packaging/AGENTS.md`

## Programming Guide

These rules apply across the codebase:

- keep implementations lean; prefer refactoring and simplification over adding bloat
- do not repeat code unnecessarily; when logic repeats, extract a shared implementation
- design new functionality to be reusable when that reuse is realistic
- do not hardwire features directly to each other when a small explicit contract or abstraction will do
- prefer composition, registries, and stable module boundaries over ad hoc cross-dependencies
- code must stay clean, readable, and reusable
- avoid boilerplate and ceremony unless they solve a real maintenance, safety, or clarity problem
- use deterministic discovery patterns for pluggable systems
- keep each handler type in one predictable folder and load implementations by explicit name, config, or convention
- apply the same deterministic loading rule to API handlers, watched-file handlers, workers, and other extension points that serve the same role
- do not create one-off loader paths for a single feature when that feature belongs in an existing handler or extension system
- in `server/`, name multiword scripts, modules, handler ids, and endpoint files with the object first and the verb second, and use underscores consistently, for example `file_read`, `login_check`, `user_manage`, `pages_handler`, and `path_index`
- when multiple objects should share the same interface, prefer JavaScript classes with a shared superclass and explicit overridden methods
- do not model shared interfaces as plain objects that are inspected at runtime to see whether a function exists
- use ES module syntax throughout the codebase; prefer `import` and `export` and avoid CommonJS forms such as `require` and `module.exports`
- some legacy CommonJS still exists in the repository; treat it as migration debt, not as a pattern to copy
- keep as much agent logic in the browser as possible
- treat the server as infrastructure, not as the main application runtime
- prefer explicit, small contracts between browser and server
- prefer maintainable filesystem structure over clever routing shortcuts

## Structure And Concepts Overview

Top-level structure:

- `space`: root CLI router that discovers command modules dynamically
- `commands/`: CLI command modules such as `serve`, `help`, `get`, `set`, `version`, and `update`
- `app/`: browser runtime, layered customware model, shared frontend modules, and browser test surfaces
- `server/`: thin local infrastructure runtime, with root page shells and public shell assets under `server/pages/`, request routing under `server/router/`, API hosting, fetch proxying, watched-file indexes, auth/session infrastructure, and Git support code for update flows
- `packaging/`: optional Electron host and packaging scripts; keep native hosts thin

Project concepts:

- browser first, server last
- modules are the browser delivery unit for code, markup, styles, and assets
- browser modules are namespaced as `mod/<author>/<repo>/...`
- frontend extensibility is a core runtime primitive, not an add-on; framework bootstrap installs `space.extend` first, and the browser runtime grows by loading modules that expose extension points which are then extended by further modules
- frontend visual guidance, semantic color palette, and shared backdrop primitives are owned by `/app/AGENTS.md` under `## Visual Guidance`; agents making UI changes should read that section and use `app/L0/_all/mod/_core/framework/css/colors.css` plus `app/L0/_all/mod/_core/framework/css/visual.css`
- the layered browser model is `app/L0` firmware, `app/L1` group customware, and `app/L2` user customware
- `app/L1` and `app/L2` are transient runtime state and are gitignored; do not treat them as durable repo-owned sample content
- `app/L2/<username>/user.yaml` stores user metadata such as `full_name`; auth state lives under `app/L2/<username>/meta/`, where `password.json` stores the password verifier and `logins.json` stores active session codes
- the server resolves `/mod/...` requests through that layered inheritance model using watchdog-backed indexes and a `maxLayer` ceiling parameter that defaults to `2`
- the `/admin` frontend clamps module and extension resolution to `L0` with `maxLayer=0` so admin UI assets stay firmware-backed even though app file APIs still operate on normal `L1` and `L2` paths
- the browser authenticates through the server, uses a server-issued session cookie for protected API and file access, and clears that session through `/logout`
- framework composition is rooted at `/mod/_core/framework/js/initFw.js`, which initializes the `space` runtime for the current browser context and imports the extension system before other framework modules so later modules can extend the runtime tree deterministically
- app file APIs now operate on app-rooted paths such as `L2/alice/user.yaml` or `/app/L2/alice/user.yaml`, not on `/mod/...` cascade paths; `file_read`, `file_write`, `file_delete`, and `file_list` also accept `~` or `~/...` as shorthand for the authenticated user's `L2/<username>/...` path; `file_read` plus `file_write` accept either single-file input or composed batch `files` input; `file_delete` accepts single-path input or composed batch `paths` input; and `file_write` creates directories when the target path ends with `/`
- read permissions are: a user can read their own `L2/<username>/`, and can read `L0/<group>/` and `L1/<group>/` for groups they belong to
- write permissions are: a user can write their own `L2/<username>/`; a user can write `L1/<group>/` only when they manage that group directly or through a managing group include chain; members of `_admin` can write any `L1/` and `L2/` path; nobody writes `L0/`
- non-`/api` and non-`/mod` browser entry routes are served from `server/pages/`; public shell assets under `/pages/res/...` are served from `server/pages/res/`; `/login` is public and the protected page shells live behind the router-side session gate
- the server-side backend under `server/` is expected to use ES module syntax throughout
- detailed browser-runtime rules live in `/app/AGENTS.md`
- detailed server-runtime rules live in `/server/AGENTS.md`

## Documentation Maintenance

All agent-facing documentation lives in the repository `AGENTS.md` files. The root `README.md` is intentionally removed so the project has one documentation system for agents instead of split, drifting sources.

Documentation ownership:

- `/AGENTS.md` owns repo-wide rules, project identity, top-level structure, CLI surface, packaging surface, and documentation policy
- `/app/AGENTS.md` owns browser-runtime architecture, layer rules, frontend patterns, and app-specific current state
- `/server/AGENTS.md` owns server responsibilities, API contracts, watched-file/customware infrastructure, and server-specific current state
- `/commands/AGENTS.md` owns CLI-module conventions and the command-tree-specific contract under `commands/`
- `/packaging/AGENTS.md` owns native-host and packaging-surface guidance under `packaging/`
- subtree-local `AGENTS.md` files may document narrower implementation areas when they stay consistent with the primary docs

Documentation rules:

- keep app-specific details in `/app/AGENTS.md`, not in the root file
- keep server-specific details in `/server/AGENTS.md`, not in the root file
- do not duplicate detailed app or server information in `/AGENTS.md`; keep root high level and point to the owning file
- when subtree-local `AGENTS.md` files exist, keep them scoped, concise, and consistent with the root/app/server docs
- do not create parallel `README.md` or `readme.md` files for architecture or agent guidance; keep durable project documentation in the AGENTS files rather than split README architecture notes
- after every edit session, review whether architecture, folder layout, commands, API contracts, loader behavior, watcher behavior, extension points, or conventions changed
- if they changed, update the relevant `AGENTS.md` files in the same session before finishing
- if a change affects both app and server, update both local docs and update the root file if the top-level contract changed
- remove stale or contradictory documentation immediately; do not leave drift for later
- when code reveals undocumented architecture, document it
- keep these files explicit, current, and high signal at all times
