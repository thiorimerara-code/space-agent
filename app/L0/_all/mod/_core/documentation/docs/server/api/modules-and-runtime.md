# Module And Runtime APIs

This doc covers the non-file API families that matter most to the browser agent.

## Primary Sources

- `server/api/AGENTS.md`
- `server/lib/customware/module_manage.js`
- `server/lib/auth/service.js`
- `app/L0/_all/mod/_core/framework/js/api-client.js`

## Public Auth And Health Endpoints

Current public endpoints:

- `health`
- `guest_create`
- `login_challenge`
- `login`
- `login_check`

Important notes:

- these are the only explicitly anonymous endpoint families today
- password login flows through the shared auth challenge/proof service
- `guest_create` creates a guest `L2` user only when runtime config allows guest accounts

## Module Endpoints

Current module endpoints:

- `module_list`
- `module_info`
- `module_install`
- `module_remove`

These delegate to `server/lib/customware/module_manage.js`.

Important behaviors:

- module writes must reuse shared permission rules
- module writes should refresh the watchdog afterward
- module list surfaces distinguish areas such as `l1`, `l2_self`, `l2_user`, and `l2_users`
- cross-user or aggregated user-layer module listings are admin-only

## Runtime And Identity Endpoints

Important runtime endpoints:

- `extensions_load`
- `password_generate`
- `user_self_info`

`extensions_load`:

- resolves HTML and JS extension files through the layered override system
- supports grouped extension lookups
- is the shared backend for frontend extension loading
- receives grouped lookup batches from the frontend; the batching policy itself lives in the frontend loader, not in the endpoint contract

`user_self_info`:

- is the canonical frontend identity snapshot
- returns `{ username, fullName, groups, managedGroups }`
- should be used by browser code to infer writable roots instead of relying on a broader serialized permission blob

`password_generate`:

- is authenticated
- returns a backend-sealed password payload
- should stay narrow and backend-owned

## Health Helper

The frontend API client exposes `space.api.health()` for the health endpoint.

It returns a small status shape rather than a broad runtime dump.
