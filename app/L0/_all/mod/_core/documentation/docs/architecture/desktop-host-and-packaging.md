# Desktop Host And Packaging

This doc covers the Electron desktop host and the packaging scripts that build native desktop outputs.

## Desktop Host Startup

The Electron host stays thin:

- it starts the existing Node server runtime from `server/app.js`
- it waits for `listen()` before reading runtime fields such as `browserUrl`
- it opens the browser UI inside `BrowserWindow`

Current startup contract:

- the desktop host binds the backend to `127.0.0.1`
- it passes `PORT=0`, so the OS assigns a free local port for that launch
- packaged apps also force `WORKERS=1`, so the standalone desktop host stays on the single-process server runtime
- packaged apps also set `CUSTOMWARE_PATH` to `<userData>/customware`, so writable `L1/` and `L2/` content stays in the native OS user-data location instead of inside the installed app bundle
- after `listen()`, the server runtime updates its public `port` and `browserUrl` fields to the resolved bound port
- the host loads `${browserUrl}${launchPath}` instead of reconstructing a fixed URL from config

## Packaged Versus Source-Checkout Behavior

Current Electron behavior differs only where the native-host contract requires it:

- packaged apps force `SINGLE_USER_APP=true`
- packaged apps force `WORKERS=1`
- packaged apps persist writable customware under the native user-data root through `CUSTOMWARE_PATH`
- packaged apps open `/enter` as the recovery-safe launcher shell
- source-checkout desktop dev runs keep the normal runtime auth flow
- both packaged and source-checkout runs use the same free-port startup flow
- packaged release bundles lazy-load the Electron updater after the window is created, do not run a startup update check, expose bundled-runtime info plus explicit updater actions through `spaceDesktop`, let `/enter` run the background check and reveal an update button only when a newer bundle exists, keep downloads and restart-to-install as explicit user actions, keep the native window title composed with the current page title so updater status remains visible on `/enter` and later routes, mirror readable updater diagnostics into the renderer console, show progress-bar status while checking or downloading, and install them on restart instead of mutating installed files in place with the source-checkout `space update` command
- updater package-load failures, offline launch, and update-check network errors must not prevent the local server or browser window from launching

`preload.js` exposes `spaceDesktop` to renderer code with `platform`, `getRuntimeInfo()`, `checkForUpdates()`, `downloadUpdate()`, and `installUpdate()`, so recovery-safe shells such as `/enter` can detect packaged app runs, run a background check, and then trigger explicit native update actions without authenticated module dependencies.

## Packaging Outputs

Desktop packaging is owned by `packaging/scripts/desktop-builder.js` plus thin per-platform entrypoints.

Current build behavior:

- reads the root `package.json` `build` config
- keeps the root `package.json` version aligned with the current Git-derived release version, because npm script banners and some packaging fallback paths read that metadata directly
- keeps desktop-host runtime modules such as `electron-updater` in the root `dependencies` block so they are copied into the packaged app, while `packaging/package.json` stays limited to build-tool dependencies
- normalizes tag-like versions such as `v0.22` to a semver build version through `packaging/scripts/release-version.js`, so CI and local packaging can stamp the desktop app version consistently; the resolver checks explicit `--app-version`, release env vars, an exact checked-out Git tag, and finally the root package version, and it also derives the published two-segment release version by stripping a redundant trailing `.0` patch when present
- keeps `directories.app` pinned to the repo root because the Electron host entry lives outside `app/`, while excluding repo-local `app/L1/` and `app/L2/` content because packaged apps relocate writable customware into `<userData>/customware`
- keeps `app/package.json` in the bundle so the app tree stays an ES module package boundary, which means that nested package file must keep basic metadata such as `name` and `version`
- includes both the extensionless `space` wrapper and `space.js` in the bundle so the packaged host still carries the documented CLI entrypoint surface it depends on
- keeps packaging scripts focused on building artifacts only; GitHub Release publishing is handled by the release workflow instead of by a local `--publish` script flag, with `release-assets-stage.js` preparing the final upload set
- keeps GitHub publish provider config in the effective build config so `electron-builder` emits updater metadata, while the wrapper passes `publish: null` so local and CI packaging scripts never upload directly; because `electron-builder` skips bundled `app-update.yml` on macOS `--dir` builds unless updater-capable targets are present, the wrapper must backfill that file into unpacked `.app` outputs for local updater testing
- keeps the canonical source icon artwork under `packaging/resources/icons/source/` and derives platform-specific packaging icons from it
- points macOS packaging at that source PNG so `electron-builder` can compile the final app icon internally, while Windows and Linux use checked-in derived assets under `packaging/platforms/`
- enables hardened-runtime signing inputs for macOS and keeps notarization credential discovery in the standard `electron-builder` environment-variable flow
- allows local macOS packaging without signing credentials by honoring `SKIP_SIGNING=1` in the desktop builder wrapper, and also accepts the launcher-style `APPLE_PASSWORD` env var as a local alias for `APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD`
- publishes platform-specific GitHub updater metadata so packaged apps can resolve new installers and bundles from the GitHub Release they were built for, using the canonical release asset names `metadata-latest-windows.yml`, `metadata-latest-mac.yml`, `metadata-latest-linux.yml`, and `metadata-latest-linux-arm64.yml`
- disables `npmRebuild` so optional native dependencies such as `nodegit` do not block desktop packaging when fallback Git backends are already available
- keeps `asar` disabled so the bundled project tree stays watchable on disk
- writes platform artifacts under `dist/desktop/<platform>/`
- for macOS, the default targets are `dmg` and `zip`
- `--dir` produces an unpacked `.app` output for local inspection, and on macOS the packaging wrapper also backfills `Contents/Resources/app-update.yml` so those local unpacked builds can exercise the release updater

## Tagged Release Workflow

Repo-level desktop publishing lives in `.github/workflows/release-desktop.yml`.

Current release contract:

- the workflow runs automatically on pushed `v*` tags
- normal `main` branch pushes do not publish desktop releases unless the `v*` tag ref is pushed too
- automatic tag-push runs publish desktop artifacts when the selected tag is already on `origin/main` history and no newer `v*` tag is already on `origin/main` after it
- manual `workflow_dispatch` runs require an existing Git tag input and use that same gate, so failed or partial releases can be rebuilt after `main` has advanced as long as no newer release tag has already landed on `main` after the requested one
- fresh builds cover Windows, macOS, and Linux on both x64 and arm64 runners
- local and CI builds share the same packaging scripts, with CI passing the tag-derived semver build version through `SPACE_APP_VERSION`
- release notes are generated automatically from the commit range between the previous published release and the current tag, with an empty previous tag allowed when no prior published release is available, and CI requires the OpenRouter prompt helper under `packaging/resources/release-notes/` to return a non-empty AI-written body
- the publish job merges per-arch macOS and Windows updater metadata, promotes Linux updater metadata into the canonical root names `metadata-latest-windows.yml`, `metadata-latest-mac.yml`, `metadata-latest-linux.yml`, and `metadata-latest-linux-arm64.yml`, stages public installer assets according to `packaging/release-asset-filters.yaml`, and also stages those metadata files plus the exact archive and blockmap asset names referenced inside them so `electron-updater` can resolve GitHub Release updates
- staged public installer files use uniform `Space-Agent-<release version>-<platform>-<arch>.<extension>` asset names; when the semver patch is `0`, the workflow strips that redundant third number so tags such as `v0.40.0` publish as `Space-Agent-0.40-<platform>-<arch>.<extension>`, while the packaged app itself keeps the full semver build version required by the desktop toolchain and the updater metadata keeps the full semver-linked archive names it references
- every release run rebuilds fresh desktop artifacts, updates the GitHub Release for the selected tag, removes stale unprefixed selected-asset names left by older workflow attempts, and uploads that selected artifact set with `--clobber` so manual reruns replace failed or stale assets instead of publishing a second release
