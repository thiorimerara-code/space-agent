# Runtime Overview

This doc is the shortest map of the whole system.

## Core Idea

Space Agent is browser-first:

- the browser app in `app/` is the primary runtime
- the server in `server/` is thin infrastructure for page shells, auth, APIs, module delivery, app-file access, and outbound fetch proxying
- the CLI in `space.js` plus `commands/` starts and manages that runtime

The repo is designed so the agent can act through browser state plus narrow backend contracts instead of moving application logic onto the server.

## Major Entry Files

- `space.js`: CLI entry router that discovers commands dynamically
- `commands/serve.js`: runtime startup command and launch-time param overrides
- `server/server.js` and `server/app.js`: create and start the local HTTP runtime
- `server/router/router.js`: exact request ordering
- `server/pages/*.html`: server-owned page shells for `/`, `/admin`, `/login`, and `/enter`
- `app/L0/_all/mod/_core/framework/js/initFw.js`: frontend bootstrap
- `app/L0/_all/mod/_core/router/`: authenticated root app shell
- `app/L0/_all/mod/_core/onscreen_agent/`: floating routed overlay agent

## Runtime Surfaces

- `/`: authenticated app shell, then `_core/router`
- `/admin`: authenticated firmware-only admin shell with `maxLayer=0`
- `/login`: public sign-in shell
- `/enter`: recovery-safe launcher shell for launcher-eligible sessions
- `/api/<endpoint>`: backend endpoint surface
- `/api/proxy`: authenticated outbound fetch proxy
- `/mod/<author>/<repo>/...`: browser module delivery
- `/~/...` and `/L0/...`, `/L1/...`, `/L2/...`: authenticated direct app-file fetches

## Layered Runtime Model

The browser and the module resolver use three logical layers:

- `L0`: firmware, immutable by normal runtime writes
- `L1`: group customware
- `L2`: user customware

Important consequences:

- frontend modules are delivered through `/mod/...`, but their backing files may come from `L0`, `L1`, or `L2`
- writable `L1` and `L2` may live under `CUSTOMWARE_PATH/L1` and `CUSTOMWARE_PATH/L2` even though logical paths stay `L1/...` and `L2/...`
- admin UI module resolution is clamped to `L0` through `maxLayer=0`

## Documentation Sources

For work in this repo, use these in order:

1. user request and explicit local context
2. relevant `AGENTS.md` files
3. the docs in this module
4. concrete code

Read `architecture/documentation-system.md` next if you need the documentation rules themselves.
