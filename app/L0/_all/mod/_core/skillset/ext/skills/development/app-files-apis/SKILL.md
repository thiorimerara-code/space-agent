name: App Files And APIs
description: Use the frontend API surface correctly for app files, discovery, identity, and permission-aware browser data access.
---

Use this skill when frontend code needs to read or write app files, inspect the current user, discover files by pattern, or call backend endpoints from the browser.

## Core Frontend API Surface

The shared frontend runtime exposes authenticated backend helpers through `space.api`.

Current wrapped helpers include:

- `await space.api.fileList(pathOrOptions, recursive?)`
- `await space.api.fileRead(pathOrFiles, encoding?)`
- `await space.api.fileWrite(pathOrFiles, content?, encoding?)`
- `await space.api.fileDelete(pathOrPaths)`
- `await space.api.fileCopy(pathOrEntries, toPath?)`
- `await space.api.fileMove(pathOrEntries, toPath?)`
- `await space.api.fileInfo(pathOrOptions)`
- `space.api.folderDownloadUrl(pathOrOptions)`
- `await space.api.gitHistoryList(pathOrOptions, limit?)`
- `await space.api.gitHistoryDiff(pathOrOptions, commitHash?, filePath?)`
- `await space.api.gitHistoryPreview(pathOrOptions, commitHash?, operation?, filePath?)`
- `await space.api.gitHistoryRollback(pathOrOptions, commitHash?)`
- `await space.api.gitHistoryRevert(pathOrOptions, commitHash?)`
- `await space.api.userSelfInfo()`
- `await space.api.call("endpoint_name", { method, query, body, headers, signal })`

`fileRead(...)` accepts one logical path, one `{ path, encoding? }` entry, or a `files` batch. The frontend wrapper now coalesces same-tick reads into one `/api/file_read` request and re-slices the returned files back to each caller, retrying individually when a combined batch fails so shorthand paths and optional missing-file reads still behave like standalone calls. Explicit batching is still best when you already have the file list, but small independent reads no longer fan out 1:1 by default.

`fileWrite(...)` still supports the simple replacement form `fileWrite(path, content, encoding?)`, but object-form writes also support incremental updates: `{ path, content, operation: "append" }`, `{ path, content, operation: "prepend" }`, or `{ path, content, operation: "insert", line | before | after }`. Insert writes accept exactly one anchor, use the first literal `before` or `after` match, treat `line` as a 1-based insertion point, and require `utf8`. Batch writes may set those fields per entry or once at the top level as defaults. Prefer these incremental write modes when you only need to add or place text instead of rereading and rewriting the whole file.

Use `space.api.folderDownloadUrl(...)` when the browser should trigger a regular authenticated folder download without buffering the ZIP file into frontend memory first.

When a UI needs user-visible download failure feedback without fetching the archive blob into memory, preflight the request with `space.api.fileInfo(...)` for files or `space.api.call("folder_download", { method: "HEAD", query: { path } })` for folders before starting the browser download.

`fileList(...)` accepts `{ access: "write" }` or `{ writableOnly: true }` when discovery must be limited to writable paths. Use `{ gitRepositories: true, access: "write" }` or `space.api.call("file_paths", { method: "POST", body: { patterns: ["**/.git/"], gitRepositories: true, access: "write" } })` to discover writable local-history owner roots; the server returns paths such as `L1/team/` and `L2/alice/`, not `.git` metadata.

`gitHistoryList(...)`, `gitHistoryDiff(...)`, `gitHistoryPreview(...)`, `gitHistoryRollback(...)`, and `gitHistoryRevert(...)` are available only when the backend runtime has `CUSTOMWARE_GIT_HISTORY=true`. They operate on writable owner roots such as `~`, `L2/<user>/`, or `L1/<group>/`; list supports `limit`, `offset`, and `fileFilter`, preview returns affected files and optional operation-specific patches for travel or revert, diff reads one commit-file patch, rollback requires write permission and preserves ignored L2 auth files plus forward-travel refs, and revert creates a new inverse commit. The first-party `#/time_travel` page defaults to the authenticated user's `~` history and can switch to write-accessible `L1` or `L2` history roots through the repository picker.

## Logical Path Rules

- Use logical app-rooted paths such as `L2/alice/user.yaml`, not disk paths.
- `~` and `~/...` target the authenticated user's `L2/<username>/...` path.
- These logical paths do not change when writable storage moves under `CUSTOMWARE_PATH`.
- `fileWrite(".../")` creates a directory because the path ends with `/`.
- `.git` metadata under writable owner roots is server infrastructure and is blocked from app-file reads, writes, direct fetches, and indexed discovery.

## Discovery Rules

- Use permission-aware APIs, not ad hoc browser path guesses.
- Use `space.api.call("file_paths", { method: "POST", body: { patterns: [...] } })` for indexed glob discovery; add `access: "write"` for writable-only results.
- Use `space.api.call("module_list", ...)` only when you need module inventory metadata rather than raw file paths.
- Use `space.api.call("extensions_load", ...)` when the browser needs module-owned `ext/...` assets resolved with layered override behavior, such as HTML adapters or JS hooks. Keep `maxLayer` at the top level of the call, and when batching grouped lookups send ordered `patterns` entries and read grouped results back in that same order.
- Use `file_paths` plus `fileRead(...)` for readable module metadata files such as `ext/panels/*.yaml` when you only need logical file discovery and file contents rather than the `extensions_load` response shape.

## Storage Rules

- Browser storage is for small non-authoritative UI state.
- Persistent user or group state should live in app files or explicit backend APIs.
- Use `space.config` only for frontend-exposed runtime params, not for general persistence.
- Browser code may update the current user's `~/user.yaml` directly when changing browser-owned metadata such as `full_name`, but password rotation must stay backend-owned through `space.api.call("password_change", ...)` instead of writing `~/meta/password.json`.

## Identity Snapshot

- `space.api.userSelfInfo()` returns `{ username, fullName, groups, managedGroups, sessionId, userCryptoKeyId, userCryptoState }`.
- Treat `app/` as the frontend repo tree and `server`, `commands`, and `packaging` as read-only from this frontend skill set.
- The current user may always write `L2/<username>/` and `L2/<username>/mod/`.
- The current user may write `L1/<group>/` and `L1/<group>/mod/` for each entry in `managedGroups`.
- If `groups` includes `_admin`, the user may write any `L1/<group>/...` or `L2/<user>/...` path except `L0`, which remains firmware-only.
- Readable group roots still follow group membership and layer rules; use `development/layers-ownership` when you need the full read-resolution model.

## Boundary Rule

- This skill is for consuming backend APIs from the frontend.
- Do not change backend handlers from this skill set; load `development/backend-reference` when you need the read-only backend model behind these APIs.
- Prefer frontend logic plus existing `space.api` helpers over asking for new backend endpoints.
- Ask for backend permission only when the browser cannot safely enforce the required security, integrity, cross-user, or stability boundary on its own.

## Mandatory Doc Follow-Up

- If the frontend API surface, app-file path rules, or indexed discovery behavior change, update the mirrored docs and the `development` skill subtree in the same session.
