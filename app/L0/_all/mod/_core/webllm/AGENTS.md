# AGENTS

## Purpose

`_core/webllm/` owns the first-party browser inference test surface for WebLLM.

It provides a routed page at `#/webllm`, keeps the WebLLM runtime isolated inside a dedicated module-local worker, and exposes a minimal test chat for loading browser-side models, sending plain chat turns, stopping inference, and reporting simple throughput metrics.

Documentation is top priority for this module. After any change under `_core/webllm/`, update this file and any affected parent docs in the same session.

## Ownership

This module owns:

- `view.html`: routed test page for WebLLM model loading and chat
- `store.js`: page store, worker lifecycle, UI state, and routed surface behavior
- `webllm-worker.js`: dedicated worker that imports the vendored WebLLM runtime, loads models, streams deltas, and handles stop/reset actions
- `helpers.js`: shared model-selection, conversation-shaping, and metric-formatting helpers used by the page and worker
- `protocol.js`: stable message names between the routed page and the worker
- `webllm.css`: page-local layout and chat styling
- `web-llm.js`: vendored browser build of `@mlc-ai/web-llm`, kept local to this module so the route works without backend or global framework changes

## Local Contracts

Current route contract:

- the test route is `#/webllm`
- the page is browser-only and should not require backend API changes
- the routed page is intentionally a compact, low-chrome manual test surface, not a general agent runtime
- the sidebar should surface the currently loaded model first, inside a slightly more prominent rounded panel with a larger model label, a compact right-aligned state badge, and an unload control beside the model name; while loading, that action should switch to `Stop` and cancel the in-flight load/download, and the progress bar should keep a small visible fill immediately so startup does not look stalled before precise progress arrives
- on desktop, the route should sit slightly inside the viewport instead of filling it edge to edge, and the models block should expand to consume the remaining sidebar height above the advanced section
- the advanced custom-model form should stay collapsed by default
- the system-prompt editor in the chat column should stay collapsed by default so the thread and composer keep most of the height

Current worker and runtime contract:

- the main thread does not import the vendored WebLLM runtime directly; only `webllm-worker.js` imports `web-llm.js`
- the worker lazily creates one `MLCEngine`, reuses it across reloads inside the route session, and terminates when the routed page unmounts
- worker messages are centralized in `protocol.js`; keep the page and worker aligned there instead of inventing ad hoc postMessage strings
- model loading progress comes from WebLLM's `initProgressCallback` and is forwarded to the page unchanged except for the surrounding worker envelope
- the page persists the last successfully loaded model config in browser storage and should auto-reload it when the route mounts again in the same browser profile

Current model-loading contract:

- users may either load a prebuilt WebLLM `model_id` or provide a custom model URL plus model library URL
- custom model loads must stay local to this route; do not add repo-wide runtime params or backend storage just to support them
- when a custom model id is blank, the module derives one from the model URL
- the page should expose the full vendored `prebuiltAppConfig.model_list` through a searchable compact list with direct per-model load actions
- the prebuilt list should distinguish cached and uncached models, use `Download <size estimate>` for uncached entries, `Enable` for cached entries, and `Unload` for the currently active prebuilt entry, and expose a `Downloaded` filter that only shows cached prebuilt models
- cached prebuilt entries should read slightly brighter than uncached rows, while the active prebuilt entry should be outlined in green so it is easy to spot in the compact list
- cached prebuilt entries should also expose a red discard control that removes the model's cached browser files to free space; discarding the active prebuilt model must unload it first and then clear its persisted auto-restore selection
- keep cached-action buttons compact; `Enable` and `Unload` should size to their label, while uncached `Download` buttons may use a slightly wider fixed width so the list stays aligned
- the filtered prebuilt list should keep compact row heights even when only a few results are visible; do not stretch sparse result sets to fill the available column height
- prebuilt model loads should come from the visible compact list; do not hide a separate freeform prebuilt-id field
- the advanced custom-model load button should only use explicit custom fields, never an implicit hidden prebuilt selection
- do not present arbitrary Hugging Face repo discovery as a normal load path; official WebLLM custom loading still requires MLC/WebLLM-compiled artifacts plus a compatible `model_lib` wasm
- model downloads, caching, and wasm fetches are owned by the browser-side WebLLM runtime; this module should not add server proxying or backend model state unless a later request explicitly asks for it

Current chat and metrics contract:

- the page supports only plain system prompt text plus plain user and assistant chat turns
- the chat column should present a `Testing chat` heading with the clear-chat action inline beside it
- there is no tool execution, skill routing, attachments, queueing, or persisted history in this module
- the stop action must call WebLLM interruption in the worker so the request can terminate with `finish_reason: "abort"` when the runtime supports it
- assistant metrics are attached after a response finishes, using WebLLM usage extras when available and a simple elapsed-time fallback only when needed
- assistant replies should render their model id and performance metrics as one compact inline row below the response body instead of large stat cards
- sparse chat threads should stay top-aligned and keep compact message heights; do not stretch message rows to fill the thread column
- the chat column should keep the thread and composer visually dense; avoid oversized message padding, oversized model rows, or expanded prompt editors by default

## Development Guidance

- keep this surface self-contained under `_core/webllm/` unless a later request explicitly promotes shared helpers into `_core/framework` or `_core/visual`
- prefer worker-side WebLLM changes over main-thread imports so the test page remains responsive during model load and generation
- keep the routed page simple, dense, and legible; it is a test harness, not a polished chat product
- if the route path, worker protocol, vendored runtime version, or model-selection contract changes, update this file, `/app/AGENTS.md`, and the matching docs under `_core/documentation/docs/`
