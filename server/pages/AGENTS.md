# AGENTS

## Purpose

`server/pages/` contains the server-owned HTML shells and public shell assets.

These files define entry shells and pre-auth presentation only. They should not become a second frontend application runtime.

Documentation is top priority for this subtree. After any change under `server/pages/`, update this file and any affected parent or linked module docs in the same session.

## Ownership

Current page shells:

- `index.html`: authenticated root shell for `/`
- `admin.html`: authenticated admin shell for `/admin`
- `login.html`: public password-login shell for `/login`
- `enter.html`: firmware-backed launcher shell served at `/enter` for launcher-eligible sessions

Current public shell assets:

- `res/space-backdrop.css`
- `res/space-backdrop.js`
- `res/enter-guard.js`
- login-shell image assets under `res/`

## Shell Contracts

`index.html`:

- loads shared framework CSS and `/mod/_core/framework/js/initFw.js`
- when the current request already has launcher access, receives a page-shell guard before `/mod/...` assets so a new tab or window is redirected to `/enter?next=<current-url>` before customware loads
- receives injected `meta[name="space-config"]` tags for any `frontend_exposed` runtime parameters
- keeps the body minimal and exposes exactly the `body/start` extension anchor

`admin.html`:

- loads the same framework bootstrap with `?maxLayer=0`
- when the current request already has launcher access, receives the same page-shell guard before `/mod/...` assets so a new tab or window is redirected to `/enter?next=<current-url>` before admin shell assets load
- declares `meta[name="space-max-layer"]` with content `0`
- receives the same injected `meta[name="space-config"]` tags for `frontend_exposed` runtime parameters
- keeps the body minimal and exposes exactly the `page/admin/body/start` extension anchor

`login.html`:

- is public and must not depend on authenticated `/mod/...` assets
- owns the login flow, guest creation flow, and pre-auth layout
- reads injected `meta[name="space-config"]` tags directly so guest-login UI can follow backend runtime parameters without authenticated module imports
- grants same-tab launcher access in `sessionStorage` after successful password sign-in so the tab that just authenticated can land on `/` while fresh tabs still route through `/enter`
- keeps the self-host call-to-action visually separated from the sign-in form even when guest account creation is disabled and the guest-only block is hidden
- keeps the mobile shell scrollable when the viewport is shorter than the content, and reserves extra small-screen side spacing for the intro column rather than inflating the login card
- keeps login-specific styling and motion local

`enter.html`:

- must stay safe even when routed customware is broken
- must not depend on authenticated `/mod/...` assets
- is served for launcher-eligible sessions; in multi-user mode, unauthenticated requests are redirected to `/login` before this shell loads
- owns the firmware-backed launcher UI that links to `/` and `/admin`, labeled as Enter Space and Admin Mode
- accepts an optional `next` query param, grants per-tab launcher access through `sessionStorage`, and routes the Enter or Admin buttons back to the original target when appropriate
- mirrors the login-shell intro layout, floating astronaut, and public backdrop while replacing the right-side form card with direct launcher actions
- keeps extra small-screen side spacing around the launcher shell and a generous top and inter-button gap when the launcher actions collapse below the intro copy
- should reuse the mirrored public backdrop assets instead of introducing a second standalone visual system

## Public Asset Mirroring

`/login` and `/enter` cannot rely on authenticated module assets for recovery-safe shells, and launcher-gated page shells must redirect before customware loads, so `server/pages/res/space-backdrop.css`, `server/pages/res/space-backdrop.js`, and `server/pages/res/enter-guard.js` mirror the public-shell recovery behavior.

Rules:

- keep the mirrored public backdrop aligned with `_core/visual`
- if the shared backdrop visuals or runtime behavior change, review and update these mirrored files in the same session
- keep public-shell assets under `server/pages/res/` instead of embedding large data blobs into page HTML

## Development Guidance

- keep page shells thin and static
- expose stable anchors and let browser modules own dynamic composition
- keep recovery-safe shell behavior local to `login.html`, `enter.html`, and `server/pages/res/`
- do not hardwire authenticated app structure into page shells when an extension seam can own it
- if page-shell contracts or mirrored public assets change, also update the matching docs under `app/L0/_all/mod/_core/documentation/docs/server/`
- if page-shell contracts or mirrored public assets change, update this file and the related app docs
