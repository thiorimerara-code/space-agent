# AGENTS

## Purpose

`server/` is the thin local infrastructure runtime.

It should not become the main application runtime. Keep browser concerns in `app/` and keep this tree focused on explicit infrastructure contracts that the browser or CLI needs.

Documentation is top priority for this area. After any change under `server/` or any server contract change owned here, update this file in the same session before finishing.

## Responsibilities

- serve the root HTML entry shells and public page-shell assets from `server/pages/`
- resolve browser-delivered modules from the layered `app/L0`, `app/L1`, and `app/L2` customware model
- expose server API modules from `server/api/`
- provide the outbound fetch proxy at `/api/proxy`
- support local development and source-checkout update flows without turning the server into business-logic orchestration

## Structure

Current server layout:

- `server/app.js`: server factory and subsystem bootstrap
- `server/server.js`: startup entry used by the CLI and thin host flows
- `server/config.js`: default host, port, and filesystem roots; host and port currently read from project `.env` keys `HOST` and `PORT`
- `server/dev_server.js`: source-checkout dev supervisor used by `npm run dev`
- `server/package.json`: ES module package boundary for the backend
- `server/pages/`: root HTML shell files served at `/`, `/login`, and `/admin`, plus optional public shell assets under `server/pages/res/`
- `server/api/`: endpoint modules loaded by endpoint name, with multiword routes named object-first such as `file_read`, `login_check`, and `extensions_load`
- `server/router/router.js`: top-level request routing order and API dispatch
- `server/router/pages_handler.js`: page-route handler for page auth gating, redirects, and page actions such as `/logout`
- `server/router/mod_handler.js`: `/mod/...` static module resolution and file serving
- `server/router/request_context.js`: AsyncLocalStorage-backed request context and authenticated user resolution
- `server/router/request_body.js`: low-level request body parsing helpers
- `server/router/cors.js`: API CORS policy and preflight handling
- `server/router/responses.js`: shared response writers for JSON, redirects, file responses, and API result serialization
- `server/router/proxy.js`: outbound fetch proxy transport used by `/api/proxy`
- `server/lib/api/registry.js`: API module discovery
- `server/lib/auth/`: password verifier, session, user file, and auth service helpers
- `server/lib/utils/`: shared low-level utilities such as app-path normalization, lightweight YAML helpers, and project `.env` file parsing and update helpers used by the CLI-managed server config flow
- `server/lib/customware/`: layout parsing, group index building, and module inheritance resolution
- `server/lib/customware/file_access.js`: reusable normalized app-path permission checks plus index-backed `file_read`, `file_write`, `file_delete`, `file_list`, and pattern-based `file_paths` helper operations, including `~` path expansion for authenticated user-relative list, read, write, and delete paths plus fail-fast batch validation for multi-path reads, writes, and deletes
- `server/lib/customware/module_manage.js`: shared module-installer helpers that validate writable module-root paths, inspect accessible overrides through `path_index` plus `group_index`, and manage Git-backed installs or updates under `app/L1` and `app/L2`
- `server/lib/file_watch/config.yaml`: declarative watched-file handler configuration
- `server/lib/file_watch/handlers/`: watchdog handler classes such as `path_index`, `group_index`, and `user_index`, loaded by name from config
- `server/lib/file_watch/watchdog.js`: reusable filesystem watchdog that dispatches matching change events to handlers and exposes handler indexes
- `server/lib/git/`: backend-abstracted Git clients and clone helpers used by the `update` command and Git-backed module installs

## Request Flow And Runtime Contracts

- request routing order is: API preflight handling, `/api/proxy`, `/api/<endpoint>`, `/mod/...`, then pages as the last fallback
- non-`/mod` and non-`/api` requests stay limited to root HTML shells and page actions owned by the pages layer
- the router-side pages handler owns page auth gating, page-route redirects, and page actions such as `/logout`
- public page-shell assets under `/pages/res/...` are served directly from `server/pages/res/` without authentication when public shells need them
- the authenticated page shells at `/` and `/admin` currently load shared framework styles from `/mod/_core/framework/css/` and bootstrap the browser runtime from `/mod/_core/framework/js/initFw.js`; `/` stays a minimal shell for the injected chat module, while `/admin` keeps its simpler dark shell and pins framework asset requests with `maxLayer=0`
- `/mod/...` requests resolve through the layered customware model, using the watched `path_index` plus the group index to select the best accessible match from `L0`, `L1`, and `L2`, and they accept a `maxLayer` ceiling query parameter that defaults to `2`
- request identity is derived from the server-issued `space_session` cookie via the router-side `request_context` helper and the watched `user_index`
- `DEFAULT_HOST` and `DEFAULT_PORT` are the current CLI-managed server config parameters; they read from project `.env` keys `HOST` and `PORT`, and the `get`/`set` CLI commands validate writable values against `commands/params.yaml` before updating `.env`
- `app/L2/<username>/user.yaml` stores user metadata such as `full_name`; auth state lives under `app/L2/<username>/meta/`, where `password.json` stores the password verifier and `logins.json` stores active session codes
- only explicit public endpoints related to authentication or health may run without authentication; other APIs and `/mod/...` fetches must require a valid session
- root page shells are pretty-routed as `/`, `/login`, and `/admin`; legacy `.html` requests redirect to those routes
- page-shell assets keep their explicit `/pages/res/...` paths and are not pretty-routed
- app filesystem APIs use app-rooted paths like `L2/alice/user.yaml` or `/app/L2/alice/user.yaml`; `file_read`, `file_write`, `file_delete`, and `file_list` also accept `~` or `~/...` for the authenticated user's `L2/<username>/...`; `file_read` plus `file_write` accept either single-file input or a top-level `files` batch; `file_delete` accepts either single-path input or a top-level `paths` batch; and `file_write` creates directories when the target path ends with `/`
- read permissions are: own `L2/<username>/`, plus `L0/<group>/` and `L1/<group>/` for groups the user belongs to
- write permissions are: own `L2/<username>/`; managed `L1/<group>/`; `_admin` members may write any `L1/` and `L2/`; nobody writes `L0/`
- watchdog infrastructure is config-driven
- `path_index` is a normal watchdog handler, not a special side channel
- `path_index` is the canonical fast lookup for existing app files and directories and is the basis for server-side path resolution and app-file listing
- `group_index` derives group membership and management relationships from `group.yaml`
- `group_index` is the canonical permission graph for group-owned app paths and should back reusable read/write/list permission decisions instead of endpoint-local logic
- `user_index` derives L2 user metadata, password verifier, and session state from `user.yaml`, `meta/password.json`, and `meta/logins.json`
- `user_index` is the canonical derived auth/session view; request identity should come from it and then flow into shared `file_access` helpers as the current username
- add new watchdog handlers by adding handler classes and wiring them in `server/lib/file_watch/config.yaml`, not by manually binding handlers in `server/app.js`

## Index-Backed App File Access

- `server/lib/customware/file_access.js` is the canonical shared entry point for authenticated app file access and path listing used by API endpoints or other server-side agent-facing flows
- `listAppPaths()` is the required implementation path for `file_list`-style behavior; it resolves existing targets from `path_index`, applies readable-scope checks with the authenticated username plus `group_index`, and returns deterministic sorted app-rooted paths
- `listAppPathsByPatterns()` is the required implementation path for `file_paths`-style hierarchy lookups; it scans `path_index` through the authenticated user's readable `L0 -> L1 -> L2` owner roots, matches owner-relative glob patterns, and returns full app-relative paths grouped by the requested pattern strings
- `readAppFile()`, `readAppFiles()`, `writeAppFile()`, `writeAppFiles()`, `deleteAppPath()`, and `deleteAppPaths()` share the same normalization and permission model; when a new endpoint needs app-file reads, writes, or deletes, extend these helpers centrally instead of duplicating path parsing or access rules inside the endpoint
- batch file reads, writes, and deletes must validate every target, encoding, and permission decision before any disk work begins; batch writes or deletes should fail before mutating anything when one entry is invalid or unauthorized
- do not add ad hoc filesystem walks for app path discovery in API handlers when `path_index` can answer the question; keep file-list operations index-backed so agent-oriented listing stays efficient as the tree grows
- do not derive group or user access state inside each endpoint; request identity comes from the router/auth flow backed by `user_index`, and reusable access decisions should combine that username with `group_index`
- after writes that can affect file existence, group membership, or user/session/auth state, refresh the watchdog so `path_index`, `group_index`, and `user_index` stay synchronized with disk
- if `file_access` rules, index inputs, or watcher coverage change, update `server/lib/file_watch/config.yaml`, the affected shared helpers, and this document in the same session

## API Module Contract

Endpoint files are named by route:

- `/api/health` loads `server/api/health.js`
- `/api/file_read` loads `server/api/file_read.js`

Multiword API route names should use object-first underscore naming so related endpoints stay grouped together alphabetically, for example `login_check`, `guest_create`, and `extensions_load`.

Endpoint modules may export method handlers such as:

- `get(context)`
- `post(context)`
- `put(context)`
- `patch(context)`
- `delete(context)`
- `head(context)`
- `options(context)`

Handler context may include parsed body data, query parameters, headers, request and response objects, `requestUrl`, `user`, app/server directory references, and watched-file indexes.

Handlers may return:

- plain JavaScript values, which are serialized as JSON automatically
- explicit HTTP-style response objects when status, headers, binary bodies, or streaming behavior matter
- Web `Response` objects for advanced cases

Current endpoint set:

- `extensions_load`
- `file_list`
- `file_delete`
- `file_paths`
- `file_read`
- `file_write`
- `guest_create`
- `health`
- `login`
- `login_challenge`
- `login_check`
- `module_info`
- `module_install`
- `module_list`
- `module_remove`
- `password_generate`
- `user_self_info`

Current status notes:

- `guest_create`, `login`, `login_challenge`, and `login_check` are the current public auth-related endpoints
- `guest_create` creates a guest L2 user, refreshes the relevant indexes, and leaves authentication to the standard session flow
- `file_read`, `file_write`, `file_delete`, and `file_list` are the current authenticated app-filesystem APIs; they operate on app-rooted paths through the shared `file_access` library, use watchdog-backed indexes for path resolution and permission decisions, and should remain the reusable contract for agent-oriented file access
- `file_read` accepts `GET` query-style single-file reads and `POST` body-based single or batch reads; `file_write` accepts `POST` body-based single or batch writes; `file_delete` accepts `DELETE` or `POST` for single-path deletes and `POST` for batch deletes
- `file_read`, `file_write`, and `file_delete` expand `~` or `~/...` to the authenticated user's `L2/<username>/...` path before normal app-path validation and permission checks
- `file_write` creates directories when the target path ends with `/`; directory writes ignore encoding and do not accept non-empty content
- `file_delete` deletes files or directories, and directory deletes are recursive
- batch `file_read` returns `{ count, files }`; batch `file_write` returns `{ count, bytesWritten, files }`; batch `file_delete` returns `{ count, paths }`
- batch `file_read`, `file_write`, and `file_delete` precheck all requested targets up front and fail fast if any target is invalid, missing, unauthorized, duplicated, or overlapping
- `file_paths` is the authenticated hierarchy-pattern lookup API; it matches owner-relative glob patterns such as `skills/SKILL.md` across the user's readable `L0`, `L1`, and `L2` roots and returns matched full paths relative to `/app`, while preserving hierarchy order and allowing directory patterns that end with `/`
- `password_generate` is an authenticated utility endpoint that accepts a JSON body with `password` as a string and returns the raw SCRAM verifier object exactly as it would be written to `app/L2/<username>/meta/password.json`
- `module_info` is the authenticated `GET` endpoint that accepts a module request path such as `/mod/acme/demo` or a concrete app path and returns the accessible override locations plus per-location Git info
- `module_install` is the authenticated `POST` endpoint that installs or updates a writable `L1/<group>/mod/<author>/<repo>/` or `L2/<user>/mod/<author>/<repo>/` directory from a Git repository with optional `token`, `tag`, or `commit`, and returns the result plus refreshed module info
- `module_remove` is the authenticated `POST` endpoint that removes a writable module directory through the shared file-delete contract and returns the result plus refreshed module info
- `module_list` is the authenticated `GET` endpoint that returns all installed modules from L1 and L2 as a flat array; it always uses `maxLayer: 2` regardless of the request context so that admin-origin requests (which run with `maxLayer=0`) still see installed modules; each entry includes `layer`, `ownerId`, `ownerType`, `requestPath`, `path`, `authorId`, `repositoryId`, and `git` info
- module installs, updates, and removes must use the shared write-permission model from `file_access`, reuse watchdog-backed `path_index` and `group_index` lookups for module-path normalization and override discovery, and refresh the watchdog after mutations so new module paths become immediately resolvable
- `user_self_info` returns the authenticated user's derived identity snapshot: `username`, `fullName`, membership groups, managed groups, and `isAdmin`, using the watched `user_index` and `group_index`
- the current page shells live in `server/pages/`, while all page-serving logic stays in `server/router/pages_handler.js`
- public shell artwork or other shell-local binaries should live under `server/pages/res/` and load through `/pages/res/...` rather than being inlined into large data URIs in HTML
- page shells under `server/pages/` should stay minimal and expose stable extension anchors when the frontend runtime should compose content dynamically; do not hardwire module components there when the `mod/**/ext/**` loader can own the composition instead
- public page shells such as `/login` should not depend on authenticated `/mod/...` assets; keep any pre-auth shell styling or assets local and aligned with `/app/AGENTS.md`
- `/admin` declares `space-max-layer=0`, and server-side module resolution honors that ceiling through explicit `maxLayer` request data plus admin-origin request fallback for browser-native `/mod/...` loads
- `extensions_load` resolves extension files from layered `mod/**/ext/**` paths using the current user's group inheritance and exact module-path overrides
- `extensions_load` accepts a top-level `maxLayer` integer in the request body, defaults to `2`, and applies that ceiling before extension override selection
- `extensions_load` also accepts grouped request batches so the frontend can debounce uncached extension discovery to one request per frame while the server resolves all requested pattern groups in one inheritance pass
- `maxLayer` only constrains module and extension resolution; app file APIs such as `file_read`, `file_write`, `file_delete`, and `file_list` continue to use their normal permission model across writable layers

## Server Implementation Guide

- keep endpoints narrow and explicit
- keep multiword API endpoint filenames object-first so related routes stay grouped together alphabetically
- prefer plain JavaScript return values for simple JSON APIs
- use explicit response objects only when needed
- keep shared server libraries infrastructure-focused and reusable
- keep proxy transport, API hosting, file watching, and persistence concerns separate from app orchestration
- keep `server/app.js` focused on bootstrapping core subsystems, not on special-case registration logic
- keep `server/pages/` limited to static page assets and keep routing logic in `server/router/`
- keep app-path permission checks in shared server libraries, not duplicated inside each file API endpoint
- keep app-file listing and path discovery in shared index-backed helpers, not in endpoint-local filesystem scans
- treat `path_index`, `group_index`, and `user_index` as maintained infrastructure contracts; optimize and extend them centrally rather than bypassing them for one-off features
- use underscores consistently for multiword server-side module files, handler ids, and helper entry points; do not introduce new dash-separated names under `server/`
- keep file-list results deterministic, permission-aware, and efficient for agent use by preferring index lookups over repeated disk traversal
- prefer deterministic loader folders and name-based discovery for APIs, watched-file handlers, workers, and similar extension points
- keep inheritance resolution explicit and small
- keep new persistence APIs explicit, small, and integrity-safe
- do not move browser-side agent logic onto the server by default
- keep backend modules in `server/` on ES module syntax with `import` and `export`
- when server responsibilities, request flow, API contracts, watched-file behavior, or persistence architecture change, update this file in the same session
